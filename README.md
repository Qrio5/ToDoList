# ToDoList
A console-based task manager.

IMPORTANT! Don't forget to clean up the folder named "ToDo" in the root of drive, where the file is located. It is used to save your tasks file and a backup.
Also if you're launching it from C drive, it probably won't create a folder. In that case you would like to create it manually.

The savefile names are: "note.txt" (the main file) and "note_backup.txt" (in case of corruption).
